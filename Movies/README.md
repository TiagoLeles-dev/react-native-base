### Part 1.2 - Create Components
let's dive into some hands-on practice! 💪 We're going to create two components that we can use directly in our App.js file. In the future, we'll create navigation and screens for different parts of the app. The first component will be a header bar, complete with a title . The second component will be a card 🃏, which will have an image , a title , and some text. With these components, we'll be one step closer to building our awesome app! Let's get coding! 💻😄

### Part 1.3 - Navigation Install and config
Let's dive into one of the most important parts of mobile development: navigation! In React Native, there's no built-in tool for screen navigation, but fear not, the documentation suggests using React Navigation. 🚀

There are three main types of navigation:

Stack: the most common navigation type, where the system keeps track of the navigated screens in a stack.
Drawer: navigation done through a side menu, usually accessed by swiping from the edge.
Bottom Tabs: navigation using visible tabs at the bottom of the screen.

To implement navigation in our project, we'll need to include React Navigation as a dependency and make the necessary configurations. Just follow the instructions in the documentation, and we'll be smoothly navigating between screens in no time! 📚🔍💻
