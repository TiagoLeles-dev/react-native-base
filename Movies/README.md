### Part 1.2 - Create Components
let's dive into some hands-on practice! 💪 We're going to create two components that we can use directly in our App.js file. In the future, we'll create navigation and screens for different parts of the app. The first component will be a header bar, complete with a title . The second component will be a card 🃏, which will have an image , a title , and some text. With these components, we'll be one step closer to building our awesome app! Let's get coding! 💻😄
